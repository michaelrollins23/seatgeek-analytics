# NFL Trade Analysis Data Pipeline (dbt + BigQuery)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a modern data engineering workflow using **dbt (data build tool)** and **Google BigQuery**. It transforms raw NFL trade transaction data into a clean, business-ready dimensional model that classifies team team-building strategies (e.g., "Win Now" vs. "Rebuilding") based on asset management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Data Warehouse:** Google BigQuery
* **Transformation & Orchestration:** dbt Cloud
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
* **Languages:** SQL, YAML

## 🏗️ Architecture (Medallion Approach)
This pipeline follows a standard Medallion (3-tier) architecture to ensure data quality and modularity.

### 1. Staging (`stg_nfl_trades`)
* Reads raw CSV data from BigQuery.
* Implements `SAFE_CAST` for pipeline resilience.
* Standardizes column names and handles the specific grain of the data (one row per asset transferred, not per transaction).

### 2. Intermediate (`int_team_trade_summaries`)
* Aggregates the asset data.
* Calculates the net draft capital and player assets given/received by each NFL team.

### 3. Mart (`fct_nfl_team_behavior`)
* The final business-facing table.
* Applies logic to categorize team behavior based on their net asset movement (e.g., heavily acquiring players while trading away picks is classified as a "Win Now" strategy).

## 🧪 Data Quality & Testing
Automated schema tests are configured in `_models.yml` to run on every build, ensuring pipeline integrity:
* `unique` and `not_null` constraints on primary keys.
* `accepted_values` testing to ensure asset types strictly fall into 'Player', 'Draft Pick', or 'Other/Unknown'.

## 📊 Documentation & Lineage
dbt automatically generates a data catalog containing table descriptions, column-level definitions, and dependency graphs.
